963	A new technology!
964	I've done it![ENTER]I have finally managed to develop a completely[ENTER]new technology.[ENTER]I've managed to process items and extract pure[ENTER]energy from them. It's absolutely brilliant!
965	If you destroy an item using my new technology,[ENTER]you will receive an Energy Fragment. If you merge[ENTER]30 of these fragments, you will receive a[ENTER]powerful Energy Crystal! Pure, unfiltered energy,[ENTER]bundled with a Gemstone. This power will flow[ENTER]into your entire equipment.[ENTER]Are you interested in it?
966	Bring equipment items such as weapons, jewellery[ENTER]and the clothing that you find whilst on the hunt[ENTER]to me. I will process them into Energy Fragments.[ENTER]Our kingdom's future and hope has been pinned on[ENTER]this technology. We will become invincible!
967	Extract Energy Fragments
968	Did it work? Did you receive Energy Fragments?[ENTER]Bring me more items and I will shatter them using[ENTER]alchemy. My technology has not quite been[ENTER]perfected yet. That's why I can never guarantee[ENTER]how many fragments you will receive.
969	There is one condition: your own level as well as[ENTER]that of the item must have a minimum level of 35.[ENTER]Hm, let's take a look...
970	You aren't strong enough yet! Come again, when[ENTER]you have reached a minimum level of 35.
971	Ah, excellent! You are strong and experienced.[ENTER]Give me the item that you want me to process.
972	You are not strong enough to control the power[ENTER]inside these Energy Fragments. Come again when[ENTER]you have reached a minimum level of 35.
973	This item is not suitable for my technology.[ENTER]Bring me something else.
974	This item does not have enough energy. Bring me[ENTER]one with a minimum level of 35 - that's the only[ENTER]way I'll be able extract its energy with my[ENTER]technology.
975	Should I destroy this item?
976	Yes!
977	No, not yet!
978	I have failed - unfortunately I could not extract[ENTER]any Energy Fragments. Perhaps I'll have better[ENTER]luck next time.
979	Wonderful! I managed to find %d Energy Fragments.[ENTER]There you go.
980	Produce Energy Crystal
981	Have you used up all your power reserves already?[ENTER]You shouldn't work so hard and put your life on[ENTER]the line in such a careless way. I will need %d[ENTER]Energy Fragments to produce an Energy Crystal.
982	You do not have enough Energy Fragments.[ENTER]I can't produce an Energy Crystal with that.[ENTER]Come again when you have collected at least %d[ENTER]fragments.
983	Very good, you have got the %d required Energy[ENTER]Fragments. I can produce an Energy Crystal with[ENTER]that. Please wait a minute. I'll try, but I can't[ENTER]guarantee it will work.
984	Everything's ready to melt the fragments into an[ENTER]Energy Crystal. However, I have to live on[ENTER]something too and my tools don't just fall from[ENTER]the sky. [ENTER] I require a small expenses[ENTER]charge of %d Yang. Are you willing to pay?
985	Of course!
986	No, not now.
987	All right, I respect your decision.[ENTER]Come again when you have changed your mind and[ENTER]need an Energy Crystal after all.
988	Sorry, you have to pay first. I'm not a charity.[ENTER]That's just business - give me the money and then[ENTER]I'll do my work.
989	Here, your Energy Crystal. But it's only the[ENTER]first attempt that's always successful. Alchemy[ENTER]is an unpredictable science - minor mistakes lead[ENTER]to failure! There is always a small chance that[ENTER]the experiment might fail.
990	Unfortunately, the attempt failed. I couldn't[ENTER]produce an Energy Crystal. My technology is[ENTER]brilliant - but the process is full of risks.[ENTER]Things don't always work according to plan. Next[ENTER]time I'm sure we'll be successful!
991	I knew it! My technology is brilliant![ENTER]Here's your Energy Crystal. It's certainly a fine[ENTER]specimen! Can you feel its power?
992	Your item has %d or more bonuses. Do you still[ENTER]want to disassemble it?

1027	Time has been reseted.
1028	Who are you?
1029	Oh, hello there!
1030	I used to be just a common priest, who
1031	was discovering beauties of nature.
1032	But i was here in really wrong time.
1033	Evil power got me. It got everything here.
1034	But, I'm glad for that. I found something
1035	new, something strong I've never seen.
1036	I protect people who are lost, this place
1037	is really bad.
1038	Only leader of the group can
1039	continue.
1040	If I'm right, you need to go trought the wall.
1041	You need a nightmare fire so you can use
1042	the cannon. I can give you the fire but
1043	I also need something.
1044	Bring me the axe, and i give you the fire.
1045	Oh, you did great!
1046	I have absolutely nothing to say.
1047	Here is:
1048	Nightmare fire:

1057	I can teleport to you to another stage, but
1058	first i need Stone of dread.
1059	I search for it really long time.
1060	It should be on this place, anywhere.
