[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]1. Introduction

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]In all games, it is a well-known fact that there is nothing 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]better than a pet to accompany our hero on his adventure. And if
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]this companion grants you powerful bonuses, it will be 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]becomes a very valuable asset for the player

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]There are 2 types of pet in Ava2. Simple pets that 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]give a fixed MVP bonus to the player and have a 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]duration and Evolutionary pets, which level up and 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]can be upgraded to increase their PVM bonuses. attributes.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]2. Normal Pets

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]Simple pets have the characteristic that they do not level up 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]level and have fixed PVM bonuses. The Phoenix that 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]given to you at the start of a quest in Ava2 is a good example
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]of this type of pet. These pets can have a duration of 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]limited duration or they can be permanent. You can find more of them at
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]the Item Shop of Ava2.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]3. Leveable Pets

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]These types of pets are special and can end up being very 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]powerful if you evolve them and train them with books of 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]pet skill books and elixirs. A good example of this kind of 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]pet is the monkey you get when you start playing Ava2. 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]These pets always come inside an egg and you must name 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]them to the get them.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14;COLOR=E51313]Lifetime.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]Pets start with an initial duration of 30 days at birth. 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]In order to extend this duration you must obtain the Protein
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]Complement which can be found by defeating dungeon bosses or ItemShop.
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]Each Protein Complement increases the pet's lifetime by 7 days.





[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14;COLOR=E51313]Evolve your Pet

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]Upon reaching specific levels the pet will require a certain amount of 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]some items in order to level up further. These levels are 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]40, 75 and 100. The items it will require in order to pass these
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]leves are:

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14;COLOR=E51313]Passive Bonus

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]These bonuses start at 0%, but you can increase them by giving
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]elixirs to your pet. There is one type of elixir for each bonus 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]and it will be distinguished by colour. Then within each bonus 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]there are 4 levels of elixirs which each serve to raise 5 LV of the bonus. 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]The Elixirs (S) will be used to raise the bonus from lv 1 to lv 5, to keep 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]the bonus from lv 1 to lv 5. to continue raising the bonus you will need to 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]use Elixirs (M), (L) and finally Elixirs (XL) until you reach max level 20.
