[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]1. Inventory

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]The normal inventory is used only for consumables, pieces of equipment and a 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]few other items. The rest of the items that you acquire will be placed in 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]the Special Inventory according to the category of the item.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]You can find the Special Inventory next to the inventory:

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]2. Equipment

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]Equipment items in Ava2 are governed by a unique rarity system. When a piece of 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]equipment is dropped by a mob, it can have 6 different rarities:

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14;COLOR=858681]*Common Item: No Extra basic bonus  |  Low Durability
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14;COLOR=FFFFFF]*Uncommon Item: +5% Extra basic bonus  |  Normal Durability
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14;COLOR=39DDDA]*Rare Item: +10% Extra basic bonus  |  Good Durability
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14;COLOR=E41414]*Epic Item: +20% Extra basic bonus  |  Very Good Durability
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14;COLOR=3FFF19]*Relic Item: +25% Extra basic bonus  |  Excellent Durability
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14;COLOR=E328E9]*Legendary Item: +30% Extra basic bonus  |  Legendary Durability

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]The durability of items is lost as you get hit or hit with your weapon. Once the 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]piece of equipment loses all durability, the item's base attributes continue to 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]function but bonuses 1-7 of the piece of equipment stop working until the item 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]is repaired.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]You can obtain Item Repairers from the general store, from the boss drop and from 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]the item shop:

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]3. Character progress

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]To level up in Ava2 and progress with your character, it is not necessary to level 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]up in the usual areas in the world of metin2. The best option to level up in a 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]balanced way and without encountering difficulties or obstacles to progress is to 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]focus on hunting metin stones and killing bosses to get better equipment. 

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]Don't forget to do the biologist's missions that you will find on the minimap button! 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]In the biologist panel you will also find a store to get the necessary materials 
[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=14]to complete each quest.

[X_PADDING=15;FONT_SIZE=14]* Kill metin stones, kill more metin stones and finally kill even more metin stones.

[X_PADDING=15;FONT_SIZE=14]* You can farm with 2 accounts at the same time, it will be good for you!
[X_PADDING=15;FONT_SIZE=14]* Dungeon bosses drop many of the items you will find in the Item Shop.
